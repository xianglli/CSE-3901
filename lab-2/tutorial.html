                Hi！Welcome to the Set Card Game design by Future Tech Corp! We know your are new to this Game. Don't worry！We will explain how to play this game in detail.
                <br /> <br />
                In the game, certain combinations of three cards are said to make up a set. For each one of the four categories of features — color, number, shape, and shading — the three cards must display that feature as 
                <br />
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; a) either all the same, or 
                <br />
                  &nbsp; &nbsp; b) all different.
                <br /> <br />
                Put another way: For each feature the three cards must avoid having two cards showing one version of the feature and the remaining card showing a different version. For example:
        </div>
        <div class = "example">
            <img scr = "./midia/Set-game-cards.png" alt = "">  
        </div>
        <div class = "set">
            For the cards above, each of them have a differnet symbol, number, shading and color. Therefore, we said they form a set.
            <br /> <br />
            Now, you have understood the basic rules of the game. Try the following buttons for some basic examples. You can also view all set combinations by clicking on the button on the right side.
